Description: The `rmkl` package aims to empower R with Intel MKL like Microsoft R Open (MRO)
  by leveraging the conda packages, `mkl`, `mkl-include` and `intel-openmp`. 
  However, it does not like MRO or `ropenblas` to directly affect R functions.
  `rmkl` aims to act like a plug-in for R users and support dynamic linkage for Rcpp users.
  `rmkl` supports windows/OS X/Linux.
